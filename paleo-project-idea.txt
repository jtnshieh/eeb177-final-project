My ranking preferences and shell command for finding unique species for each group:
-My ranking:
1. Dolphinidae (dolphins) - 102 unique species
2. Pongidae (apes) - 41 unique species
3. Canidae (dogs and foxes) - 302 unique species
-The shell command for each group:

2. Pongidae: cut -d "," -f 6,11  pbdb_data\(apes\).csv | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l
3. Canidae: cut -d "," -f 6,11  pbdb_data\(dogs\ and\ foxes\).csv | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l
