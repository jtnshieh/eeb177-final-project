conceptual basis of the project (I am interested in the effect
of the KT extinction on fossil mammals...)

discussion of data and computational challenges (I plan to
use occurrence data from the PBDB to reconstruct fossil
ranges...I will need to extract fossil age and locality data,
format it for quantitative analyses, and visualize the results...


If you are using the PBDB, you must also report the # of
unique species for 3 groups. Rank these groups in order of
preference and show the shell commands you used to
extract unique names
